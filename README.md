# Feature Breakdown

## Overview
This section provides a detailed overview of the main features and subsystems that define the project’s core functionality. Each feature is designed to enhance user experience, ensure operational efficiency, and support scalable backend interactions.

---

### 1. API Documentation
The backend APIs are documented using the **OpenAPI standard**, providing a clear and standardized structure for developers to understand available endpoints and their expected inputs and outputs.  
Through **Django REST Framework** and **GraphQL**, the system enables both RESTful and flexible query-based access to data, ensuring seamless integration with frontend applications and third-party services.

---

### 2. User Authentication
The authentication system allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely through endpoints such as `/users/` and `/users/{user_id}/`.  
It ensures that only verified users can access specific features, maintaining privacy, data protection, and account integrity throughout the platform.

---

### 3. Property Management
Accessible via endpoints like `/properties/` and `/properties/{property_id}/`, this module allows property owners to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.  
It serves as the foundation of the platform’s content, enabling hosts to manage listings effectively and ensuring that users always have access to accurate and up-to-date property information.

---

### 4. Booking System
Through endpoints `/bookings/` and `/bookings/{booking_id}/`, users can create, modify, and manage bookings, including specifying check-in and check-out dates.  
This feature simplifies the reservation process, reduces scheduling conflicts, and maintains an accurate log of all user transactions.

---

### 5. Payment Processing
The `/payments/` endpoint handles secure and efficient payment transactions related to bookings.  
It ensures that all financial activities are properly tracked, supports multiple payment methods, and provides real-time status updates for successful, pending, or failed transactions.

---

### 6. Review System
Endpoints `/reviews/` and `/reviews/{review_id}/` allow users to post, view, and manage reviews for properties they’ve booked.  
This system fosters transparency and trust by enabling users to share authentic feedback, while property owners gain valuable insights to improve service quality.

---

### 7. Database Optimizations
The backend employs **indexing** for faster query performance and **caching** to minimize database load and improve system responsiveness.  
These optimizations ensure that frequently accessed data, such as property listings and user sessions, are retrieved quickly, enhancing the overall performance and scalability of the platform.

# API Security

## Overview
Security is a fundamental aspect of the project’s backend infrastructure. The system implements multiple layers of protection to ensure data integrity, safeguard user information, and secure financial transactions. By enforcing strong authentication, authorization, and traffic control mechanisms, the API upholds the confidentiality, availability, and reliability of all interactions.

---

## Key Security Measures

### 1. Authentication
**Description:**  
All endpoints that handle sensitive operations require user authentication using secure token-based methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.  
**Purpose:**  
Ensures that only verified users can access protected resources, preventing unauthorized account access and protecting personal data.

---

### 2. Authorization
**Description:**  
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be applied to define permissions and limit actions based on user roles (e.g., admin, host, guest).  
**Purpose:**  
Prevents users from performing unauthorized actions such as modifying other users’ data or accessing restricted system endpoints.

---

### 3. Rate Limiting
**Description:**  
Implements API rate limiting to control the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame.  
**Purpose:**  
Protects the system from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, excessive API calls, and resource abuse, ensuring fair usage and consistent performance for all users.

---

### 4. Data Encryption
**Description:**  
All sensitive data, including passwords and payment details, will be encrypted in transit (using HTTPS/TLS) and at rest within the database.  
**Purpose:**  
Prevents unauthorized interception or exposure of private data, ensuring secure communication between clients and servers.

---

### 5. Input Validation and Sanitization
**Description:**  
All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.  
**Purpose:**  
Maintains system integrity by ensuring only clean, expected data is processed by the application.

---

### 6. Secure Payment Handling
**Description:**  
Payment processing is integrated with trusted third-party gateways following PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance.  
**Purpose:**  
Protects users’ financial data and ensures that all payment transactions are handled through secure, verified channels.

---

## Importance of Security Across the Project

- **Protecting User Data:** Strong authentication and encryption mechanisms prevent data leaks and identity theft.  
- **Securing Payments:** Adhering to financial security standards ensures all transactions are legitimate and confidential.  
- **Maintaining Trust:** Transparent and reliable security practices build user confidence and platform credibility.  
- **Ensuring Compliance:** Following security best practices helps align with industry regulations and data protection laws.
