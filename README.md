## Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding and documenting design properties—such as color styles, typography, and layout—ensures visual consistency across all parts of the application. These properties form the foundation of a cohesive design system that improves usability and brand recognition.

Identifying design properties from mockups allows developers and designers to:
- Maintain alignment between the prototype and the implemented product.  
- Streamline collaboration between design and development teams.  
- Achieve consistent aesthetics and accessibility across screens.  
- Reduce design inconsistencies and rework during implementation.  

Accurate documentation of these properties enables faster development, better scalability, and a uniform user experience across devices and platforms.
